Dear Michael,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request a leave of absence from November 20, 2024, to November 25, 2024, due to a family commitment that requires my attention.

I will ensure that all my current projects are up to date before my leave and will communicate with my colleagues to ensure a smooth workflow during my absence. I am committed to minimizing any disruption this may cause.

Thank you for your understanding and support. Please let me know if you need any further information or if there are any forms I should complete prior to my leave.

Looking forward to your favorable response.

Best regards,

Emily Johnson  
Sales Associate
