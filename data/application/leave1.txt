Dear Jane,

I am writing to formally request a leave of absence from November 10, 2024, to November 15, 2024, due to personal reasons. I will ensure that all my responsibilities are managed before my departure and will coordinate with my team to cover any urgent tasks during my absence.

I appreciate your understanding and support regarding this matter. Please let me know if you need any further information or if there are forms I should complete prior to my leave.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

John Doe  
Marketing Specialist
